# Project Setup Instructions

You need to install Ganache to run our project

In the project, I've used Ganache and web3.js library

* I linked Ganache testnet to backend using Express.js on port 8080.
   
* Our frontend is running on port number 3000.
   
* Our request to you, professor, is that please don't use port numbers other than mentioned above, otherwise it won't work.
   

Suggestions

* Please use mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017/Transactions URL on Windows systems and mongodb://localhost:27017/Transactions on macOS for MongoDB operations in files called /accounts/accounts.js and /transaction/transactions.js respectively.
   
* Use http://127.0.0.1:7545 URL on Windows systems and http://localhost:7545 on macOS in the above files.
