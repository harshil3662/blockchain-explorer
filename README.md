----------    you need to install Ganache to run our project   -----------

In the project, I've used Ganache and web3.js library

- I linked Ganache testnet to backend using Express js on port of 8080.
- Our frontend is running on port number 3000.
- our request to you, professor is that, please don't use port numbers other than mentioned above. otherwise it won't work.


----------- Suggestions --------------

- please use "mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017/Transactions" url on windows system and "mongodb://localhost:27017/Transactions" on MacOS for MongoDb operation in files called /accounts/accounts.js and /transaction/transactions.js respectively.
- use "http://127.0.0.1:7545" url on windows system and "http://localhost:7545" on MacOs in above files.
